## Slide 2: Introduction to Number Systems

**Heading:** Что такое система счисления? (What is a Number System?)

**Content:**  A number system is a formalized system of writing numbers.  It's a method of representing numerical quantities using symbols or digits.  Throughout history, various methods have evolved, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  We will focus on two primary categories: positional and non-positional systems.  The fundamental difference lies in how the position of a symbol affects its value.

## Slide 3: Non-positional Number Systems

**Heading:** Непозиционные системы счисления (Non-positional Number Systems)

**Content:** In non-positional systems, the value of a symbol is independent of its position within a number.  The most well-known example is the Roman numeral system.  Other historical examples include Egyptian hieroglyphs and early Greek number systems.  Roman numerals use a combination of symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) with additive and subtractive principles (e.g., IV = 4, IX = 9).  This system lacked a concept of zero and was cumbersome for complex arithmetic operations.  Consider the difficulty of multiplying or dividing large Roman numerals!

## Slide 4: Positional Number Systems

**Heading:** Позиционные системы счисления (Positional Number Systems)

**Content:** Positional number systems represent numbers using a base (or radix), where the value of a digit depends on its position relative to a radix point (usually a decimal point).  The most common positional system is the decimal system (base-10), using digits 0-9. Each position represents a power of 10 (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.).  Other important positional systems include binary (base-2, used in computers), octal (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16, often used in computer programming).  The introduction of zero was a crucial development for positional systems, allowing for efficient representation of large numbers and simplifying arithmetic.

## Slide 5: Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Comparison

**Heading:** Сравнение систем счисления (Number System Comparison)

**Content:**  Let's compare the decimal, binary, and hexadecimal systems.  Decimal uses base-10, binary uses base-2 (only 0 and 1), and hexadecimal uses base-16 (0-9 and A-F, where A=10, B=11, etc.).  Binary is fundamental to digital computers because electronic circuits easily represent two states (on/off). Hexadecimal provides a more compact representation of binary data for human readability.  Show a table illustrating conversions between these systems for a few sample numbers.  Include a brief explanation of how to perform the conversions.

## Slide 6: Conclusion

**Heading:** Заключение (Conclusion)

**Content:** We've explored the fundamental differences between positional and non-positional number systems.  Non-positional systems, like the Roman numerals, are historically significant but less efficient for arithmetic.  Positional systems, with their base and place value, are the foundation of modern mathematics and computing.  Understanding these different systems provides a deeper appreciation of the evolution of mathematics and the principles underlying digital technology.  The flexibility of positional systems has enabled advancements in science, engineering, and countless other fields.
